## Heyy peace people ðŸ‘‹

This is Ashish Roy Shayon.I am a zealous software engineering student from the University of Dhaka, I am on the journey to Code->Algo ->System Design. My bedrock in Python, Java and C++, have fueled my ability to find solutions for difficult problems and create new systems. Having a technology habit, my interest towards programming has grown significantly, it is not merely an expression of personality but matured a love for most honest meaning of software development. I take pride in the fact that I have been contributing to open source, participating in hackathons and following recent technology trends. I have a passion for learning and strive to get better every day, allowing me to keep up with the fast-paced world of software engineering I aspire to leave my mark in tech.
